# Cookie Clicker

This is a simple implementation of the legendary [Cookie CLicker game](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). It implements clicking, and upgrades (of c/c and c/s) but does not yet implement any upgrading items, or shopping facilities. Play bu running the folloging code:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_pygame.py
```

This will bring-up the pygame version of this game. There is, however, also a turtle implementeation available, which is less detailed.
